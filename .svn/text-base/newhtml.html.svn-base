                        This is a pretty subjective area of diving and until Secchi Disks are as common as snorkels we\'ll all just have to live with precisely inaccurate estimations. </td>

                        I don\'t feel I should remind anyone of what they learned in their open water class but remember:                        <li>Reports from this system are meant purely for general informat
ion and are only as accurate as the divers submitting them. </li>
                        <li>Use your head and opt out of a dive if you dong t feel the con
ditions are right. </li>

                        <li>Condition: Dive is a web-based service so there may be airtime
 or data charges from your wireless carrier&amp; and I don t see a dime of that. </li>
                        <li>Dond t attempt to report dive conditions while underwater with
out proper training. </li>
                        <li>Condition: Dive isn\'t a replacement for good judgment and careful study of the various other online resources such as <a href="http://www.garlic.com/~triblet/swell/wamglance.html"> Chuck Tribolet\'s Monterey Sea Conditions
